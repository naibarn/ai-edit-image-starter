- ✅ FE hydration mismatch resolved; Tailwind styles restored; all CI green

## Backend CI Fixes Applied
- Fixed job processing logging test by using correct fixture (`client_with_worker`)
- Updated logger.error to include exception message in log output
- Ensured worker thread is properly started for job processing tests
- Cleaned up debug print statements

## Technical Notes
- Used shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Implemented responsive design with CSS Grid
- Added proper TypeScript types
- Ensured accessibility compliance
- Created mock implementations for testing

## Risk Assessment

- ✅ Low: Using established UI patterns
- ✅ Low: Backend tests now fully green
