# H1 Completion Report

## Overview of H1
H1 - Server Logging Baseline is a critical task under Epic H (Logging & Error Handling). It focuses on implementing basic server-side logging infrastructure to capture exceptions and errors in the FastAPI application. This includes setting up a file-based logger and adding exception logging in key handlers to ensure proper error tracking and debugging capabilities.

**Key Details:**
- **Priority:** P1 (High)
- **Story Points:** 2
- **Estimated Hours:** 4
- **Owner:** BE (Backend)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Dependencies:** B2-OR (Backend Core APIs)
- **Test ID:** T-H1
- **Test Files:** `backend/tests/test_logging_server.py`

## Changes Made to backend/main.py
The following changes were implemented to establish the logging baseline:

1. **Logger Setup (Lines 17-23):**
   - Added import for `logging` module
   - Configured logger named "app" with FileHandler pointing to `logs/app.log`
   - Set formatter with timestamp, logger name, level, and message
   - Configured logging level to ERROR

2. **Exception Logging in API Handlers:**
   - `call_openrouter_api()` (Line 94): Added `logger.exception("Exception in API call")` for network errors
   - `call_gemini()` (Line 161): Added `logger.exception("Exception in API call")` for network errors
   - `images_generate()` (Line 244): Added `logger.exception("generate_image failed")` for generation failures
   - `images_edit()` (Line 305): Added `logger.exception("generate_image failed")` for editing failures

3. **Additional Error Logging:**
   - `logs_client()` (Line 317): Added `logger.error("Malformed client error log")` for malformed client logs
   - `_process_job()` (Line 346): Added `logger.error(f"job {job_id} failed: {str(e)}")` for job processing failures

## Test Results
All unit tests for H1 have passed successfully:

- **test_server_logging_on_exception:** Verifies that exceptions in `/images/generate` are logged with traceback to `logs/app.log`
- **test_server_logging_on_client_error:** Confirms client error logs are captured via `/logs/client` endpoint
- **test_server_logging_malformed_client_error:** Ensures malformed client logs are handled and logged appropriately
- **test_server_logging_on_job_processing_failure:** Validates that job processing failures are logged with job ID and error details

**Test Status:** Passed
**Note:** Tests passing - exception logging verified successfully.

## DoD Verification
Definition of Done (DoD) has been fully satisfied:

✅ **Code passes Lint/Build:** No linting errors detected  
✅ **Unit tests of story = Passed:** All T-H1 tests passing  
✅ **Log/Errors complete:** Comprehensive logging implemented for exceptions and errors  
✅ **Docs updated:** This completion report created and backlog status updated
